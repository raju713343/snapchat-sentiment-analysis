<h2><a class="anchor" id="project-overview"></a>Project Overview</h2>

This project performs a comprehensive sentiment analysis of user reviews for the Snapchat mobile application. The analysis is divided into two main stages:
- Cleaning the raw review data and adding sentiment scores using a pre-trained RoBERTa model to prepare it for analysis.
- Analyzing the cleaned data to realise sentiment trends and uncovering key themes in user feedback using wordcloud and topic modelling.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="executive-summary"></a>ðŸ“Š Executive Summary</h2>

This project analyzes over 228,000 Snapchat reviews (2018â€“2025) to uncover sentiment trends and key user pain points. Results reveal a polarized user base: 46% of reviews are positive, praising filters, camera features, and social connectivity, while 38% are negative, citing bugs, intrusive ads, and account or privacy issues. Updates in 2024â€“2025 boosted satisfaction, but persistent technical flaws and confusing features continue to frustrate many users. Overall, Snapchatâ€™s success depends on fixing core issues and enhancing trust while building on its strengths in creativity and social engagement.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="key-findings"></a>Key Findings</h2>

- **Polarized Sentiment:** 46% of reviews are positive, 38% negative, and 16% neutral, showing a divided user base.  
- **Ratings Distribution:** 43% of users gave 5-star ratings, but 1-star ratings remain consistently high.  
- **Recent Shift (2024â€“2025):** Positive sentiment surged after updates, though negative feedback persisted.  
- **Recurring Issues:** Technical problems, intrusive ads, and account/privacy concerns are the main drivers of dissatisfaction.  
- **User Priorities:** Stability, trust, and performance remain more important to users than frequent new features.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="methodology"></a>Methodology</h2>

The analysis was conducted in the following steps:
- **Data Loading and Cleaning:** The dataset was loaded and preprocessed to handle missing values and prepare the text for analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** A pre-trained RoBERTa model was used to assign sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral) to each review.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The sentiment scores and ratings were analyzed to identify trends and distributions.
- **Word Cloud Generation:** Word clouds were created to visualize the most frequent terms in positive, negative and neutral reviews.
- **Topic Modeling:** Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with Count Vectorizer was applied to identify the main topics of discussion in the reviews. Additionally, BERTopic using SentenceTransformers embeddings was employed to extract more nuanced and context-aware topics.
